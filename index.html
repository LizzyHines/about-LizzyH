    <p>ELLO!!! I'm Lizzy aka Lizzy Maguire. I'm from Disney <strike>Dearborn, Michigan</strike> but have lived
        in the 505 aka ABQ for the last seven years. I went to UNM for underwater basket weaving
        and I've been a basket weaver for about six years now. I love living here, particularly
        the food, mountains and weather. My favorite foods are <img src="https://cdn.tasteatlas.com/Images/Dishes/fde953e5aa504e8c83a84691582b0399.jpg?w=600&h=450" display: inline width="50px" height="50px">,
        <img src="https://images.heb.com/is/image/HEBGrocery/000320625" display: inline width="50px" height="50px"> and <img src="https://myhealthydish.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Shortcut-beef-pho.jpg" display: inline width="50px" height="50px">.
        My favorite pasttimes are running from commitments, cuddling with my llama, and losing games of hopscotch against my partner.
        I'm also definitely the absolute funniest person I know.
