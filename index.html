    <h1>About Lizzy</h1>
    <img src="IMG-0068.jpg">
    <p>Hello! I'm Lizzy. I'm from Dearborn, Michigan but have lived in Albuquerque for the last seven years. I went to UNM for International Studies,
        focusing on the Middle East, and I've been a server for about six years now. I love living here, particularly the food, mountains and weather. My favorite foods are sushi, apples and pho. My favorite pasttimes are running, cuddling with my dog, and losing games of chess against my partner.
        I'm also definitely the absolute funniest person I know.</p>
